"""
This script generates extracted features for each video, which other
models make use of.

You can change you sequence length and limit to a set number of classes
below.

class_limit is an integer that denotes the first N classes you want to
extract features from. This is useful is you don't want to wait to
extract all 101 classes. For instance, set class_limit = 8 to just
extract features for the first 8 (alphabetical) classes in the dataset.
Then set the same number when training models.
